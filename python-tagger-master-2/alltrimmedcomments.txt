Don't blame the kids  blame the parents for not teaching them.
The dog “BaWoAw” 😂😂
I feel like no Sabo should only apply to the kids that try really hard to act mexican but can't speak Spanish.!!most edgers😂!!
Sad fact: some immigrants felt that to assimilate was to forget their customs. Chicanos were forced to forget their language before 1968

Back story: after parents moved from Mexico they saw my brothers struggle. So they decided not to teach me. I recognize that and I’m practicing! :)
Chinga tu madre means  love you mom
And you can understand it perfectly but cant speak it
then people tell you  you're not a real Mexican for not speaking Spanish 😭
Ppl that were no sabo kids growing up and are now learning/teaching themselves rise up!
Ain’t no hate here fam we all got different childhoods😤
Why do people HATE no sabo kids? Like I don’t get it at all
why is everyone just assuming she hasn’t been trying to learn. she’s just saying it would have been easier if her parents taught her growing up
wE tRiEd YoU sAiD u DiD nOt WaNt To LeArN
Huh? I've never understood this.. you're telling me you didn't just pick it up? No one taught me I just learned it
parents fumbled the bag  thats their fault.
my parents didn’t care they made me learn yo parents ain’t strict
And they have the audacity to make fun of us for trying
guys.. she’s not agreeing with her parents. she’s just saying that’s their reasoning for not teaching her
Felt that like I’m so mad my mom never taught me Spanish bc now it’s such a disadvantage when I work bc ppl assume I speak Spanish
Some Mexicans do this so their kids don’t go through racism. My parents didn’t care and my first job out of college paid 75k cause I’m bilingual.
My grampa says random Spanish words to me then will be like “what do you mean you don’t know what it means” like dawg you never taught me💀💀💀
People acting like she hasnt been trying  its hard to learn a language  espicially when you dont get help from your parents.
Mexico beach trip for you. Tequila and sunshine will teach you all the Spanish you need to know 🔥💀
My parents spoke Spanish to me the moment I was born I struggled a little when u entered school but sense I was so young I learned English in less…
My parents taught me both and I’m fluent in English and Spanish :))
i told my little cousin "quedate quieta!" and he was like "IM A BOY" 🙃🙃🙃
Dawg I spoke Spanish up until I got to pre k  I legit picked up English in about 3 weeks lmao it’s insane how fast you can learn as a little kid
story of a lot of Mexican children and then we get hated on by all the "real" Mexicans because we can't speak Spanish 😒
this is my mom. when my mom was a kid  speaking spanish in school was frowned upon. so she didn’t teach it to me. i understand it  but now im trying
Me-core
Learning Spanish on Duolingo rn cuz no one talked to me in Spanish as a kid 😔

I hated this behavior from my mom though. In front of people anywhere in public  but if she was the one pushing the cart
Then they complain and wonder why their kids don’t want them in their lives anymore (once they age up)
Can you do “the Rosa de Guadalupe” sound with slow motion please💀💀
Staged
When I was little and couldn’t see where I was pushing the cart 😂😂
that mother was too rough accidents happen my husband did that but I gave him a good push
Nahhh my daughter has donne this n it was not on purpose  I would never treat her like that. No need to b so dramatic

WHY WAS SHE SCARED?
LMAO THE NO SABO KID 💀💀
I almost chocked on my gummy 😭
Also I wrote “Pendeho” on purpose so my video doesn’t get flagged
Dora taught me this one and even I was doubting her 💀
Hahaha!! Can you do toast next.lol 😂😂😂 This series has me laughing. 😂😂😂
Had me second guessing 🤣
Bro had me rethinking my whole vocabulary 😂😂
tell me to say embarrassed in spanish and imma head out “embarazada”🤰🏽
Bro got me worried I was turning into a no sabo
TELL ME WHY I SAID MAPIADOR 💀
Only wrong answers here: mapachín
BYE I THOUGHT I GOT IT WRONG
Bro scared me for a second 😅
Plot twist he’s also a no sabo and is just going with it😂
Mapo
Dora the Explora didn't fail me 😅
It’s Mapo obvious

Who else knows cuz of Dora 💀
Next question how do you say sandwich in Spanish

I thought I almost died right there😳😭😭
Aye bruh you got me nervous for a second
not me looking in the comments for the answer 🤣🤣😂
I would die if they asked “what’s sandwich in Spanish”
i thought it was mapation
Why does this go so well with the beat 😂
When he said Mapa I was like “wait…”
man I'm learning spa is and you had me second guessing myself lol. love this series. keep it up😁
When the no sabo way is correct
I WAS WORRIED I DIDNT KNOW ONE 💀💀
😂😂 Puerto Rican’s would’ve all lost
Y’all saying she isn’t Mexican…. DO YOU SEE HER BANGS?!!!!!
for those arguing- mexican is a NATIONALITY  not a race. I was born and raised in Mexico but my parents are from Europe. That makes me mexican!
when will ppl realize Mexicans don't look the same as every other Mexican LMAO
Wait till they find out about white Jamaicans
Saying a white Mexican is not really a Mexican is like saying white Americans aren’t real Americans but British 🤦
did y'all just forget about Spain existing
you can't be hispanic you're white yeah what do you think half the people in Spain look like???
people do realize hispanics can literally be black  white  brown  etc  right?
Y’all do realize not every ‘Mexican’ looks the same right?
Y’all know alot of Mexicans are white 😂 just because they look white that doesn’t make any less Mexican than someone’s who darker than them
Man wait til they find out Lupita Nyong’o is Mexican. Almost like it’s a country and not a race….
Y’all ever seen a white mexican?😂 They’re everywhere bro…. Dont assume everyone is white
@syrup_tasty2006 half my family
Me talking to my spanish grandfather
do I spot a gryffindor blanket?
I thought you were speaking Chinese for a second…
y’all do know that some people’s families come from Spain? And they speak Spanish 😦
yall don’t have to believe me but i’m actually mostly hispanic but my pops is white so i look white but i rlly i’m more hispanic 😍
Mexico is a massive country with over 100 million people mixed from different indigenous and European cultures...theyre not all the same color guys.
The only people who think she's not Mexican are probably Hispanics who've never been to MX.
it sounds closer to simlish
I saw at least 3 comments going “BUT SHE IS HOLDING A SPAIN FLAG”… besties… that’s a Gryffindor pillow…
tiktok normalized people saying “i am ____” and STRANGERS thinking they have the right to say “no you’re actually not bc i said so” 🥴 i hate it here
People who saying she ain’t Mexican probably the same ones who say “they’re speaking Mexican”
What do you mean half white? Your mom is whiter than me.
😂😂😂 If you think that's bad. I know a few word's in espanyole and a few in doitch. My families each speak one or the other a few generations ago.
Odio is a very strong word for Spanish moms 🥺
This is an example of a white Mexican not every Mexican with light skin is white or “white passing”
@hiiidonny hey this is definitely you lmao
😑 I luv your content no offense I can’t see u related to Cantinflas but malinshiky I can see sorry if I mispronounced that

Mi hijo también nació en California y habla Perfecto español y Perfecto inglés
He mixed some French in there “le pluton” 😅😂
Me when I'm embarrassed: 🤰
That was 100 percent correct for a no sabo kid well done 🎉🎉😂😂😂🤦
His confidence “translating” everything! 😩🤣 he’s trying well give him that credit!
His confidence 😂
how is he so confident about each word 😂😂😂
Madrugada: this one means drugs or narcotics of sorts 😂🤣 I love his confidence.
The confidence alone will make anybody believe he knows what he’s saying 😂😂 this man’s gonna be a lawyer
How did I end up on NoSaboTikTok! I’m going to sleep!! I’m done…I’m done!
I wouldn't call him a No Sabo kid though he tries & shouldn't be made fun off for it  it's the parents responsibility to teach the language 🤷‍♀️
I’m a Spanish major and this was so fun to watch! Me encanta su video! Gracias por el video.
He gets a 10/10 just for the reason he use a example for everyone word👏🏼👏🏼
¿Does he know the word chancla ?😁

Y’all tripping in the comments. I ain’t fluent in Spanish because my parents didn’t teach me but no matter what we finna be Mexican
She said Aross

the man recording made me even think she was saying “pollo” wrong 😭😭 like DAYUM
Bruh the one recording also sounds no sabo
This is why I don’t care to speak it now. Cousins in Mx asking me to say words then laughing. Spanish isn’t even our true language.
She knows Spanish just not the pronunciation 😭🫶🏼
People make fun of me for being no sabo. I have to go through the talk of I was adopted into my own family after bein in a white foster home for years
No bc her parents probably spoke mostly English to her 😭
A Ross
Sorry not sorry but I hate when family members make fun of me for not knowing Spanish but when I try they still make fun of me like get over it
she looks like she was born from the mainland but can’t speak spanish 😂😂😂😂😂😂
She’s so pretty
Th thing is I can speak some Spanish but never do bc I’m afriad 😭
This is what makes them not want to learn/speak trust me
That's not the ONLY reason but that is a big reason I don't visit any of my family lol
She don’t roll her R 😭
Woah 😳 she pretty
she bad tho 😩
And this is why I don’t speak Spanish around my family 🫠 obviously it’s not gonna sound too good if I have to teach myself

Same 🤣🤣 I always mess up my Spanish when speaking to my mom too.
Bro every time that happens I just talk English
I don’t live with her but I even feel intimidated 😅 the auto correction never fails in a Mexican household 😂 @Ana Saia
that's why I'm a no sabo kid I understand it be will respond back in English 😹 which is considered disrespectful but hey yo no sabo no sabo ☠️☠️
I feel so SEEN right now 😳😂
Hahaha you are fucking cute !!!!
Then she throws whatever she has at you because you used el instead of la one time 😂
Girl you’re amazing. I didn’t start speaking Spanish until I was in my 20s and never around my parents
is she always like mad when you speak Spanish?? cuz didn't she teach you the Spanish you know?
did she say paladar? I've never heard it called that. to me paladar is palate. retenedor dental is retainer for me.
Girls it’s okay me too 😭you’re not alone😭
NO CAUSE SAME do they call you a no sabo kid too : )
hahaha i love this so much
@browneyedgirl530 me asf trying to speak Spanish 🧍🏽‍♀️💔
Same girl .
It's her fault for not teaching you earlier 😂😂She just has to deal😂😂😂😂
I love how she corrects you… it’s what I need to do 😭 so my kids Spanish can improve hahaha
Just so u know pelirroja has 2 Rs bc it's between vowels. Carro  Pelirroja  Carretera... All of these are written with 2 Rs bc the R is between vowels
I'm the same way. it's low key embarrassing.😂
I would learn sign language if she was my Ma lol
love you're Spanish
Okay but my whole family says parkiar😂😂

Parquear and cachar are also used in Spanish
✨ParKiar✨😂😂

I just realized that when he said “ askiar” he meant to ask 💀💀💀
Does the king respond? 👑
I mean he got parquear right at least in PR 😂
supper funny dude
he used all the no sabo kid words
They make u take a Spanish test before you enter.
no sabo kid and was able to understand everything 😎
I don’t get it what does he mean by buenas nalgas a todos like what what he want to say😂
cachar is a word used in chile
I feel like this is true
Love this 😂😂😂😂😂
no es catchar 🤔
my family uses catchar and parkiar
Do when ur dad pushes u into driving and the no sabo says " no sabo driviar "
I lost my Spanish for a bit but slowly getting it Back💪
You should make a video of you shopping with a mom and you tell her that dress or something is expensivo

the fact that I'm a no sabo kid makes me sad cuz my family always makes fun of me and that makes my confidence go down😞
@maiko.gurll @icespace12rl why I got the fricken haircut😅 they forced me to “esos pinches pelos rojos”
We could cry in Spanish ?
Legends says that he never got a hair cut

“No Se” cual “No Sabo” that’s what my mom did me when I was little

My sister in law told me I have a letra for you and I was like what’s a letra?? You mean a carta? A letter is a carta not a letra mensa 😂
Mom was doing the most 😅😅😅😅
The sad part is it’s the parents fault 😏
my son belongs to that same community of no sabo 😂😂😂😂🙈🙈
𝚒𝚝'𝚜 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚙𝚊𝚛𝚎𝚗𝚝𝚜 𝚏𝚊𝚞𝚕𝚝 𝚝𝚑𝚘😂😂😂
tell your son is Ok  our ancestors did not speak spanish either 🤔🤨🤭🤭
NO SABO COMMUNITY RISE UP ✊🏻
When my 20 years old son said “mi teléfono está morido” instead of my phone is dead.😳😂😂😂🥰
My 2 kids are no sabos and that do not make them less Latinos. Let's normalize our kids speaking whatever make them comfortable without judgment IJS
but I only have myself to blame... 2 no Sabo kids and 1 that doesn't speak any spanish....😬
My daughter belongs to the “ Quiero ir con tu” community 😂
No sabo community? Ok but Spanish is a white language from Spain so.....
😂😂 this but with the Rosa de Guadalupe sound
In our defense  we were forced in other words to learn Spanish. Our parents knew/know no other language. So that’s all we had to speak.
how does calling someone a "no sabo kid" help motivate anyone to keep speaking and improving?
What episode of 𝐿𝒶 𝑅𝑜𝓈𝒶 𝒹𝑒 𝒢𝓊𝒶𝒹𝒶𝓁𝓊𝓅𝑒 is this?? 😂😂
I'm too white to understand  what's wrong with "no sabo?"
I’m part of that community where Both my Spanish and English is bad 😅
Mom  chill 🤚 . Speaking two languages imperfectly should be praised and encouraged. So what if it’s not perfect?
And that is you and your baby daddy’s fault 😂 lmao should have spoke to him in Spanish more growing up
the funniest thing is most parents of yo Sabo kids can't even speak proper English and won't hesitate to make fun of a Spanish mistake
Me with my kid. He literally understands everything. But he’s a no sabo kid.
it’s a trade off. Being multilingual means being somewhat less proficient in both  but it’s well worth it overall.
I am also a parent to No Sabo kid's 😒
imagínense cómo pide la horchata? 😂
How Jenny 69 orders tacos

@who_is_crystal__ @smiley_chqrls1 gavin aaron leo and the teacher in class
😂 That is true
No sobo take notes 😏
my brother something me
you almost go me in trouble
Gatekeeping people from their own culture  that's... special
For some of us  it wasn’t a choice. We didn’t CHOOSE not to learn Spanish. That wasn’t our fault.
I’m too anxious to speak Spanish  even though I fully understand it AND it was my first language 😅
It’s actually very hurtful that our parents didn’t teach us Spanish.(wanted us to be American) So  we don’t fit anywhere.
My mom didn’t teach me Spanish to avoid further discrimination and in order to “assimilate.” It’s literally a survival response for some families
Girl thank you for voicing our troubles. I completely agree. My family knows spanish. I just never learned. I’m not any less of my background 🤷🏽‍♀️
Did encanto teach y’all nothing?🙄
People forget Latinx families were shunned from speaking Spanish  resulting in generations not learning the language. People who were exposed
I’m half Mexican and half white and don’t know Spanish.Language is not in your DNA or make up your heritage. Proud Latina ✊🏽
That girl argues SO HARD that if you didn’t grow up in Latin America  you’re not Latino/Latina like what???
It’s embarrassing having 2 Hispanic parents and not know Spanish 😂😭
Desperately. These people don’t know what it’s like to grow up not knowing your own culture and language. Constantly being told you aren’t valid. -
I KNOW Spanish. I don’t SPEAK Spanish. There’s a difference. I’m still a first generation American though ✌🏽
what's funny is most kids that don't know the language come from families that purposely don't teach them because they are now *American*
We weren't allowed to speak Spanish when we came to America so we could "blend in" and not have accents so now a lot us don't know it fluently anymore
So many parents didn’t teach their kids Spanish bc they didn’t want their kids to be bullied….and here these people come anyway
lol they really be trying to gatekeep culture 😂
Thank u thank u thank u🥺I’m so sick of my other Mex friends saying I’m not Mex cause Im light skinned. Bro my mama was born in Mexico
girl u r such a positive force ❤️
Tbh THIS is one of the reasons a lot of Latino kids don’t know Spanish. They either get made fun of for not speaking it properly  or they get shamed+
“Just to feel spicy”?!?!? Like girl they’re literally Latino. You can’t change their heritage and ancestry!
my kids in USA don't speak Spanish cause I work 12/14 hrs and they mom is American! so there a reason 4 everything!
So true being judged for not speaking Spanish and then also judged for embracing my ethnicity because I don’t Mexican enough.
also there’s latin american countries that speak other languages 😭
thank you 🤍
My mother didn’t want us to be Mexican so she refused to teach us & moved us to community mostly white. Yeah wish I knew more but I don’t
I love this video. I’m half Mexican and I look very pale and I don’t speak Spanish. Kids would bully me all the time in school and it really sucked.
my Rican parents moved us far away from the Nuyorican culture. We grew up only speaking English. We don't look Rican even being 100%. 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
it was one reason i was so scared to learn spanish as a white person because people like her made little comments about what my accent would be.
family grew up in Texas and I grew up on stories about segregation and getting in trouble for speaking Spanish in school.
Hair tutorial 🥺
They make fun of my Spanish but tell me nonstop that I should practice so I learn more😐😠
this why I stopped speaking Spanish cause they would laugh at me but give me a backhanded compliment saying it sounded cute.
Worse I speak Spanish fine just with a heavy country accent. Like how? Who was I left with to get the accent? Mom finds it funny.
my mom rolls her eyes all mad when I practice speaking it  or ask how to say something  but then complains that I don’t speak it?
You don’t even speak Spanish right 🙄 like I’m trying to practice 😭
For real!! They make fun of us but never even taught us how to speak it. Like excuse me??
My biggest pet peeve is when they make fun of us for our Spanish but we would NEVER do that to their English
I speak the second way on purpose at home lmaoooo my mom just looks at me like “I raised THAT???” 💀💀
I could’ve been fluent by now if people would’ve stopped making fun of my Spanish when I was little. Now I only understand/read everything 🥲
My dad wanted me to learn English only because he said it’s the hardest language & NOW he sees the importance of being bilingual -.-
Don’t lie  you speak Spanish like the second part 😂
Tell me you’re from Texas without telling me you’re from Texas 😅😂 way to out me like that
no joke haha i hear my self like this
The yo no sabo in us be making a special appearance sometimes
This is me too. I thought my accent was okay until my sister was like could you not 🥺
i get this! im learning now and i am speaking correctly but still dont have the confidence to order my tacos de asada. thanks mom&dad😑
@vane3829 ur family
My mom didn’t teach me Spanish because her friend said that we should learn English only 😐🤚 who do I hate crime first 🙄
THIS IS HOW EVERYONE AT SCHOOL HEARD ME (I went to a Hispanic majority school and I’m half white and nobody believed me when I said I speak Spanish
I purposely learned the accents so people wouldn’t make fun of me 😅😬
People love to hate on my Spanish bc I don’t have an accent like where am I gunna get one I’m American 😭 except I don’t sound like the second one 😂
What my husband hears 😂
You look like bree larson
I’m a Spanish/Bio double major and Latina but I’ve always been shy to speak Spanish in front of my family. My uncle heard me
LOL
right like how u gon tell me to speak more spanish but then bully me cuz it doesn’t sound perfect 😭😭
i thought my accent was good until my tía said that my cousin's is first and mind is second 😢
Oh god I don’t even know how I sound in English or Spanish 😬
Literally why I don’t sing in Spanish around mine 😂
No sabo kids

I'm not a no sabo kid but when speaking to the carnicero I forget all my Spanish  I stutter and forget what I want 😂
the delayed beep for me. jajaja
I’m not a no sabo I’m a no sepo 😂
A while back my dad sent me to the carniceria to get godornices and I had to call him in the middle of ordering bcuz I couldn’t remember how to say it
One time when asking for ice coffee I said cafe con hielo
Lol 😂
I said 2 libs when I was like 10 😂
Nah I just say chicken or just say something that’s I could say or call my mom 😂💀
it's bc I'm dyslexic that's why it's hard for me to speak Spanish 😪
Like it’s my fault my mother didn’t teach me. She was always working and I barely saw her.
or when you "como se dese"
I wasn't expecting that. That was a good one😁 ♥️🤎❤️👏

Question: where is that Vicente video?
@mariabetancourt2129 bro 😂
first igg??
“It’s just a video it’s just a video”
At least you’re trying
“𝚗𝚘 𝚜𝚊𝚋𝚘 𝚕𝚒𝚏𝚎 𝚌𝚑𝚘𝚜𝚎 𝚖𝚎” 🤣🤣🤣 𝚏𝚛 tho  𝚍𝚘𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚐𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚝 𝚋𝚛𝚘.
it's also hard to practice Spanish when basically we speak English everywhere at work  in school  to place orders etc..
As a fellow blaxican I understand ✊🏽🇲🇽
let's remember that Spanish is the language of our colonizers anyway.
keep doing your thing king👑🙌🏽
You are doing great man  keep on trying
100%!!! pero ignora a esa gente bro. keep doing you! I love seeing you connect with your roots through language. it's how I learned too 👌🏾🙌🏾
No hate this is why I don’t speak Spanish. Ppl laugh when I’m trying to learn. A lot of ppl.
You’re doing great ignore them.
Let them hate primo. Love the videos
no preocupes bro levanta la carra y sigue viviendo. I've been learning for the past 6 years now and everyday i learn something new! 🤙🤙
the ones that make fun of your Spanish are the "arono" people! the ones that in 30 years being in the USA have not learned English
Don’t listen to the haters
As an interpreter my vocab is profesional born and raised in Mexico I know better that to criticize someone making the effort to learn our language.
My role model 🫶🏽
My daughter won’t speak Spanish because every time she tries people always make fun of her accent 😌
I don’t get why people make fun of “no sabo” kids like they’re trying at least my brother no longer wants to because he was made fun of all the time
this is one of the reasons I stopped talking to my family in spanish. I only respond in English so now they are forced to speak in English
I started to read books in Spanish out loud. It really helps with getting the fluidity of the language back.
Don't worry people will judge regardless If you speak well
I don’t judge you yo videos funny wouldn’t blame you just keep making them videos
its not his fault his american accent is so strong
@jessssm46 i didn’t choose the no sabo life bbs 🥺

This is called translanguaging - when people use all of their language repertoire to make sense of their world. It’s amazing she’s using that! :)
that's what we call ✨translanguaging✨ and we love it. bilingual scholar.
Nah Ella sabo pera ta confused
My sister one time said “I’m tossing a lot” and I asked her tossing que es eso? And she said tosiendo 😒 and I started laughing 😂
My sister says “I’m suveling it” - translation: I’m turning up the volume 😭😂
Pobrecitos lol the confused stage
Understandable lol my little cousin says gimelo mixing the words give and damelo 😂😂😂😂😂

My niece would ask me to tupper her (tapar) or to paint her hair (peinar) 😂😂😂
My cousin said he helped his sister pack her mallet for her trip to Mexico😂he meant maleta 🧳
“But stay the camera there” 😂😂🥺

My daughter used to say I love you to the Moona n back 😅 Luna+moon

this reminds me when i was little i went to the nurses office and told her i was coughing a lot  but bc i didn’t know how to say coughing in spanish
I swear the no sabo kids be coming up with new words every day
@javieresparza505 the kids “ mami can you suvale it “ when they want the volume up. Hahahhahahah
Ummmm this is beautiful lol   I used to say “cased” instead of married when I was little 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That is why it’s best to use either Spanish when they were younger and then when they’re like one or two years old start speaking English so they won’
@timasanter15 STAY THE CAMERA 😩😭

Bruh
SMH
The I love you 😂
🤣😭I can’t
This is what I’m talking about….
The slur is used against all Latinos but it’s meant to target towards Mexicans. That’s their way of generalizing all Latinos as Mexicans
It’s only for Mexicans but I agree with the rest.
my mom has learned to settle for less. and it makes me sad cuz we all settle for less. my whole family.
It really pisses me off that we are labeled as the race that doesn’t complain and are praised for it sometimes. We shouldn’t be ashamed for speaking
We need Black and Latinx unity (I’m black) and thank you for speaking on this
We need to do a better job at respecting not just others but ourselves. Don’t let someone say that to you and be ok with it smh
THIS THIS THIS.
she’s saying it’s used against all latinos bc people just assume all latinos are mexicans she’s not saying all latinos can say it tho. understand!!!
bro “the race that doesn’t complain” is the perfect way to say it. we have to be better than those before us.
The “all Latinos are assumed Mexicans” is very true! Whenever I say I’m Afrolatina and say my dad’s side is Latinx they often assume Mexican.
No one is gonna take our community seriously until our own community starts doing it :(
the words Hispanic and Latinx are mixed up a lot and for those who don’t know Hispanics are people that are from Spanish speaking country  Latinx are+
it’s only for mexicans :)
Ive been saying this for a while now. The close minded & hatred that comes from the latinx community against its own but still against others is our—
My best friend is Mexican and I’m black I love y’all too much to not defend y’all 💜💜
You said it amor!!! Agree with you
You are such a wise an eloquent young lady. Thank you 🙏
i dont get it !! and no ones explained it to me  why can only mexicans say it ??
THANK U FOR EXPLAINING IT SO PERFECTLY
Genuine question is it just Hispanic or Latinos as well cause they aren’t the same thing-
us? girl i wasn’t born in this country 🧍🏻
Plz tag me in the sound
btw congratulations on ya 3 minutes. anyways  i'm sorry that people don't understand that is wrong. 🥺😭😭 it's not right. & yes i understand ya
Never seen anyone offended by that before tbh

Literally all my siblings I’m so grateful I do ❤️and now my daughter will too
EXACLY
Parents fault tho  but they can still learn tho❤️
i’m just too mixed idk which to speak -🇬🇹🇨🇴
NOW THATS ONE GIOD BOOK YOU GIT THERE
i understand some spanish.. its kinda hard to speak tho😭😭 like i do know a lot of spanish but like not a lot a lot
I’m mostly know most things but def our parents fault for not passing the language down
My parents would laugh on how I spoke Spanish. I would ask for help and they thought I said things funny. Now they wonder why my Spanish is bad.
My son is 5 and he is bilingual  but watches all his cartoons/movies in SPANISH. He prefers spanish... and i’ll keep it that way 😌
My parents used to make fun of me for not knowing Spanish when I went to college I made them pay thousands of dollars for my Spanish classes 🤷🏾‍♀️
My mom had a rule when we were young. English at school and Spanish at home.
I think a lot of parents just assume their kids will learn like them  but they were bilingual out of necessity & trauma not as an intention
Yeah if my parents gave up on us responding in Spanish I would not be fluent. I am forever grateful
Kids become no Sabo kids bc they create poor relationships with their kids. I don't speak to my parents much at all. thus  use Spanish so little
this is so judgemental. like not every parent has the mental space to keep that up.
Lmaooo I've read studies that show that kids need peers to speak to in the other language  not just adults. Apparently it makes a difference.
I take FULL responsibility for my daughter not knowing spanish.
I don’t understand how this would be taxing on the parent?? People act as if you’re saying to sit them down and show them the conjugations
Lazy: parents that work so damn hard that they are never home. And the kid likes to watch TV in English....
My mom would ignore us when we responded in English
We only spoke Spanish in our home. We could watch tv in English though. Now we read  write  and speak in Spanish. I’m glad my parents did that.
Yes. My mom was a firm Spanish at home English at school. Even with siblings.
Totally agree! It’s parent’s responsibility to teach Spanish to their children
I get her point but sheesh what's up with attitude?!!! in my case my mom pinay and my dad latino and they both work really hard and I have disable bro
Full immersion helps too. I worked with Spanish only speaking co-workers and I became their translator. It improved my language so much
our special education teacher told us to speak both English and spanish one parent for each language consistently would work best.
It’s still your fault 😂😂 I am dead
This is why I tell my kids to speak to me only in Spanish
my mom was controlling. she didn't speak to us in Spanish so she could talk grown up talk in spanish.
YES 🙌🏼 - how did you relearn Spanish ?
Yes! My daughter is 6 and we are strict with her Spanish since starting school her Spanish has gotten a bit bad but were strict on her still and she
Raising my son bilingual has been difficult. Dad only speaks English and we moved states away from my family to a small town with no Spanish speakers
How are you an “elementary teacher” and talking about parents like that? It is not as easy as it sounds teacher Spanish in a country that prides
My bf and I agreed if we have kids he will only speak to our child in Spanish & I  in English  our families will do the same bc idk Spanish he does
SORRY to many BUT AMEN. i am trilingual...no one ever thinks i speak the other two as a mother tongue too. two different gymnastics.
Yooo my dad used to do that 😂 he’d be like NO TE ENTIENDO when we’d speak English but it works 🤷🏻‍♀️
60 is Sesenta (think of s for six) 70 is setenta with a t
bro thas me bruh i forget how to say 60 n 70

😂😂😂 que dijo?
There’s certainly a lot of division within our community
Yessssss to everything u said yes
My mom doesn't speak Spanish  so I don't either and I tell you the dirty looks I get from people who speak Spanish and I tell them I don't is astonish
Spanish isn’t our language though  it was forced on us 🤷🏽‍♂️
Let’s talk about how they’re nice to gringos who are learning Spanish and how they bash Latinos for wanting to learn Spanish 💀
I've noticed as a Latina who doesn't speak Spanish that latines are nicer and more accepting to non-latines practicing/learning Spanish than people
A lot of Latine ppl SWEAR Espanol isn’t also a colonizers language.
omg thank u 😭 i’ve always distanced myself from being latina because i feel ashamed that idk spanish.
Lol i used to get told I was white washed for not speaking Spanish well. I was always like “FOOO WHO BROUGHT SPANISH TO THE AMERICAS?!? YTPpl!!” 🤦🏽
Thank you  my issue is I understand most of it  but can't speak it because my Dad didn't want us speaking anything but English in his household
This honestly makes me feel less bad about not speaking Spanish bc I’ve honestly tried to learn but I only the basics and I have no one to practice w/
I had someone get really mad at me for not speaking Spanish very well. Told me I should be ashamed I don’t speak my mother tongue I was like I speak
This is the same in the Arab culture! My dad who is from Jordan didn’t think we needed to learn Arabic and every Arab person gives me ish for it 😭
💯💯we gotta have more empathy
NOT ME READY TO CRY IN THE COMMENTS  literally my whole life not being Latine enough because I could understand my family  but no respond. 😭
Thank u for this. My grandfather wanted us to assimilate so bad he refused to teach my mom Spanish and wouldn’t let them listen to Spanish music
ALL OF THIS!!! Spanish is a colonizers language anyway  and not the only language spoken by Latinx people.
i feel sometimes people forget that Spanish is really hard to learn.
I am the only one in my family that doesn't speak Spanish. everytime I would ask my dad to sole speak to me in Spanish SO THAT I CAN LEARN in the
speak on it 🗣
I would probably speak so much more Spanish if I didn't think my cousins and uncles would mock me for trying
Pt.1 We can’t go back to our religious roots tho…. We have been diluted so much by the colonizers  slaves and the natives. Not all Latinos have native
My grandparents stopped speaking Spanish at home when my mom was in grade school  she can understand but she can't hold a conversation in Spanish 1/
thank you  this means SO much omg
ok but its literally not our language either its the language of our oppressor our colonizer like im good I already know one colonizer tongue
no seriously though  my bf’s family is like this with me bc i can’t speak spanish  yet i’m constantly teaching them about how we were colonized 1/2
TELL THEM  LIKE HELLLOOOO
Non-latine people who speak Spanish get so much praise but because I actually am Latine and I can’t speak sp. that well  I get made fun of
i remember when i was coming back from mexico  the border patrol agent wouldn’t let us across until i said something in Spanish
spanish isn’t our language lol
my abuelitos go to a Spanish speaking doctor. it makes me happy to know that they will understand with no language trouble.
It's especially when non-English speaking Latinos are put down and mocked by other Latinos.🥺
Yes  our Spanish Speaking community should get the same health care services as anyone else. If they make fun of how you pronounced something do they
There's a reason there's no national language! We are a melting pot of different cultures!
Thank you. I encourage all my Spanish speaking coworkers to speak English and remind them that their accent is amazing. Then they help me with my
my grandma straight up got ignored at the hospital because nobody spoke Spanish. thankfully she's okay now.
This is why I always go to doctor appts with my mom
I had to learn Spanish myself as a senior in HS. Parents never taught us Spanish for the reason you stated.
America doesn't have an official language *for a reason* and the discrimination is shameful.
Yes!!! I’ve had friends who have gone to MEDICAL SCHOOL that have reached out to me to help them make a “cheat sheet” of terms in Spanish
the problem is that every Spanish speaking country has its own variations of words   🤔 think USA  England  Australia  Ireland  times 6
Y don’t u know Spanish tho
Spanish was spoken in the part of the world that is now The United States long before English was.
That is also why I teach my mother English and if anyone else needs my help with translating things I will do it and give them my number and time that
and the translators you call tend to speak Spanish in a heavy accent. Spanish speaking people feel bad telling them they don't understand
My cousin d1ed because of medical racism and it breaks my heart every day
is it because they didn't speak english?
The reason I don’t know Spanish is because of how my grandparents were treated. They didn’t teach my father
You are so right about being discriminated for not speaking Spanish. I am fluent in English but Many people would speak bad about my (1)
@spoiledcheesecake truuu
What do you expect  this is AmeriKKKa
I don’t disagree. But I also feel like it’s employers’ obligation to remunerate staff that broker other languages for them.
Yes!!!
Wow
Unfortunately it’s always been this way in the medical field
I love your lanyard. Can you share where you purchased it?
So sad to hear. Thank you for your service and effort to save more people by having a heart and desire to help
FACTS‼️
I honestly never heard anyone say yo sabo until this app
Like is it because I’m black ?😭
Me vajadecir que no?🤣🤣🤣😅
they the ones be making fun of you accent too n can’t even say anything in spanish lol
Remember that time when Twitter lost it's mind when they realized Cardi B was Dominican ?
Omg whatttt you look 100% colombian  they would be surprised if they went to colombia.
I knew you were Latino when you said “can you please explain me” instead of “explain to me” 🥰
That's bc they think we are only brown skin and black or white are like invisible for them lmao
Yeah I don't like that but also the whole conversation about is "gringos can't see that a white person can be latino" but never about afrolatinos
100% no sabo kids. Why is that? 😂 Like now we know less…
yo no sabo kids i wheezed
how does a latino look! im so over people trying to dictate how a latino person should look
not the no sabo slander 😂 we just want to quietly make it through the day without someone invalidating our ethnicity
Latinos - we come in different shapes  colors and sizes… that’s what makes us beautiful 😜
😂😂😂 They know you better than you
Its not always them  but it is them most of the time.
they know about your whole life only watching a 15s tiktok 🤠
It’s cuz ppl asume that all Latinos look the same  tan skin  round eyes  and from Mexico. Like bestie we come in all different shapes and colors.
they were literally born and raised in the states and never been to their native country  and they hace the audacity to say that afrolatinos or white+
I’m starting to see that I’m not the only one.
IT'S ALWAYS THE YO NO SABO KIDS 😂😂😂
👏👏 go ahead and educate them😂
I've been told that "but you're whte" almost every time I answer questions ABOUT MY OWN CULTURE. It's like only JLo & Sofia Vergara "look Latina"
no
literal 😏
I sense a costeño accent
People don’t know their history. Now it’s a crime to even say you have Spanish blood  even though we all do! We are a mix of Spanish  indigenous 
the yo no sabo kids 😭😭😭

Side note  is that a Loteria lanyard?😃
here is the thing  kids with speech impediments...parents were sometimes told to pick a language. my niece is 27  that happened.
My son is 5 and his (⚪️) speech therapist told me it would be better if I stopped speaking to him in Spanish 😑. So now he’s a no sabo kid
literally me! I was in speech therapy for 6 years  but in spanish I still struggle since I never went to speech therapy for my spanish
You still don’t know
My brother in law has the same problem except they told them to stop talking to him in Spanish to not confuse him and he hates that no one ever
I’m just still very insecure  I still can’t get out of basic Spanish 🥺 but I still try to practice when I can.
OMG I LOVE YOUR LANYARD!!
Where’s part 2?!?! 🥰
you couldn't make the r sound. you must be puerto Rican
my daughter has "problems" with speech  she wanted a vlog and I made her a tiktok for her to practice talking I feel like it I'll help her @lexi_talks
Not me looking for the part two and not finding it 😭😭😭
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

My daughter is 5 and can’t pronounce “r” she says “I” for r. I am going to reach out to her doctor
My 6 yr old has a heavy speech impediment as well 🥺
Thank you! 💕 I swear I thought I was the only one. No ones understands why speaking Spanish is difficult for me. Cant wait to see part 2!

Thanks for sharing. Looking forward to hearing more!
This is off topic but I absolutely LOVE your hair! And I totally relate to this🥰
Lol I was the the same way. I didn’t learn English until the 4th grade and thanks to my then speech therapist.
My family has been in teaching for many years and I find your videos refreshing. Keep it going!
